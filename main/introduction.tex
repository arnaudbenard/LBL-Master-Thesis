Limitations

Microscopy:
	- optical -> video rate but crappy resolution
	- EM -> rasterscan can slow electron beam fast
	- AFM -> slow mostly because of bulky mechanics: intertia (mass of the system), toshi ando small piezos (small range) but fast

Using spiral has been shown to be better(demands less BW x,y) but need display of non gridded data (lower res. freq. system)

z is still limiting to go on large scales (x,y)
