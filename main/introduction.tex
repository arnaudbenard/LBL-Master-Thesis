\chapter{Introduction}

In 1986, a group of scientist from IBM research developed the first Atomic Force Microscope.\cite{binnig1986atomic} The original idea is to measure forces between a sharp tip and a sample. This force bends the cantilever according to Hooke's law. The deflection is measured using a laser reflected from the top of the cantilever into a photodetector(array of photodiodes). The application of AFMs ranges from measuring elastic properties of biological samples to imaging of graphite\cite{radmacher1997measuring} \cite{hansma1988scanning}
Using a XY-scanner to move the sample on the horizontal plane allows to acquire data on different areas. Also, an AFM has a feedback system to avoid the tip to crash on the surface. The PID loop maintains a constant tip-sample force. 

The most conventional way to scan is with a raster pattern. This technique steers the tip of the AFM on specific points of a grid. Past AFM research has been focused on improving position controllers. Indeed, the AFM precision depends from the quality of the closed loop feedback on XY. These improvements, however, didn't solve fundamental problems with raster scanning. Most of the data is thrown away (trace and retrace) and the actual position on the XY plane is inaccurate - and directly correlated with the efficiency of the position controller.

Because of its limited bandwidth, fast raster scans generate distortions in the image.\cite{yong2010high} Spiral pattern allows to generate high-quality images at higher scan frequencies than the raster one. \cite{mahmood2009fast}. Moreover, this method reduces the number of sample acquired. \cite{nonrasterdata}

With raster scanning, the data is evenly distributed in space. Generating an image is trivial. Spiral scan, however, needs new techniques to render images. Fortunately, image processing algorithms like inpainting \cite{richard2001fast} or Delaunay triangulation have been developed to generate images from sparse data.\cite{nonrasterdata}.

The bandwidth on the z-axis control loop is limited by the dynamics of the z scanner.\cite{jeong:093706} We can achieve higher frequencies by using a small piezoelectric ceramic.\cite{sulchek1999dual}

In this thesis, we will see how we can use non-raster scan pattern to improve the bandwidth on the XY-plane. Also, we have developed image processing algorithms to render non-gridded data. We use the popular Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) for the rendering of the X, Y, Z data and investigate ways to use the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to improve the computing time.
Finally, we will investigate new ways to go beyond the limitations on the z-axis with tilt correction and dual actuators feedback on z. If an image is tilted, you can use first-order plane fitting to flatten the image. A more efficient way to to dynamically compensate for the tilt of the sample. Also we will see how to improve the bandwidth on the z-axis by introducing a small piezoelectric ceramics.
