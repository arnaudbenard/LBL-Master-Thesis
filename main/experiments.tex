\section{Calcite experiment}

In this experiment we've observed the dissolution of calcite ($CaCO_3$) with water. We have used our double PID feedback system and /InsertTipType. Calcite dissolution is an interesting process to observe with a high speed AFM. The whole process lasts X min which is observable with our setup. With a commercial AFM, that takes a few minutes for a raster scan, the dissolution process is hard to monitor (only a few pictures).

We have mounted our calcite sample on top of the fast piezo-electrical ceramics. Also, we have stuck a plastic cover underneath the piezo for the water.
